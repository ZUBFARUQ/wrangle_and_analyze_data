## Project Overview
### Introduction
> Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.

### Project Steps Overview

- Step 1: Gathering data

- Step 2: Assessing data

- Step 3: Cleaning data

- Step 4: Storing data
